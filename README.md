## 3. Prompt Enhancement Tips and Tricks

Prompting in 2026 is less about magic words and more about reusable task design.

- Write the job, context, constraints, output format, and quality bar separately.
- Ask for assumptions before final output when the task is ambiguous.
- Use examples for style, schema, and edge cases.
- Request a critique pass: "find weak spots, missing facts, and risky assumptions."
- Convert one-off prompts into reusable templates with variables.
- For coding agents, include repo rules, test commands, files to inspect, and definition of done.
- For agents, state tool permissions, stop conditions, budget, memory policy, and escalation rules.
- Keep a prompt changelog when a workflow becomes important.

## 5. Agentic Coding Assistants

These tools are now part of the AI engineer's daily workflow. Learn the workflow, not just the brand.

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) - terminal coding agent from Anthropic; useful for repo exploration, edits, tests, and automation.
- [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) and [Codex CLI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431-openai-codex-cli-getting-started) - OpenAI coding agent for local and cloud software tasks.

Practice loop:

1. Ask the agent to inspect before editing.
2. Give it a small, testable task.
3. Review diffs carefully.
4. Run tests locally.
5. Ask it to explain risks and missing coverage.
6. Commit only after you understand the change.

## 6. Vibe Coding for UI

Use vibe coding to move fast, then convert the output into maintainable code.

- [Gamma](https://gamma.app/) - fast decks, docs, and idea pitches.

Good UI habit: generate the first draft with Lovable/v0/Bolt, then refactor layout, accessibility, state handling, API boundaries, and tests manually or with a coding agent.

## 8. Local LLM Inference: Ollama, vLLM, and Friends

Learn local inference so you understand latency, memory, quantization, batching, and cost tradeoffs.

- [Ollama](https://docs.ollama.com/) - easiest way to run local LLMs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) - desktop local model runner.
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) - core local inference engine and quantization ecosystem.
- [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) - high-throughput serving engine for production inference.
- [Text Generation WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) - broad local model UI.
- [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models) - model discovery.

Suggested path:

1. Run a 7B or 8B model locally with Ollama.
2. Compare latency and quality across quantized models.
3. Expose a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
4. Serve one model with vLLM and test concurrent requests.
5. Log tokens/sec, time-to-first-token, memory, and cost.

## 9. Fine-Tuning and Customization

- [Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/)

- [Hugging Face AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain)
- [OpenAI Fine-Tuning Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)

Rule of thumb: try prompting, RAG, tools, and better evals before fine-tuning. Fine-tune when you need consistent style, domain behavior, extraction format, or smaller/cheaper model deployment.

## Definition of Ready for an AI Engineer Role

You are ready to apply when you can:

- Build a Python or JavaScript AI app from scratch.
- Explain embeddings, attention, tokens, context windows, tool calling, and RAG.
- Use at least one coding agent responsibly and review its diffs.
- Build a LangGraph or equivalent agent with state and tool calls.
- Run a local model with Ollama and understand when vLLM is useful.
- Evaluate a RAG or agent app with repeatable test cases.
- Deploy a small app and monitor latency, cost, and quality.
- Communicate tradeoffs clearly: model choice, safety, privacy, UX, and budget.
